This error occurs when using a third-party library that's not properly integrated with React Native's environment. For example, some libraries might rely on features or APIs that aren't available in React Native, leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.  Let's say you're using a library that expects a specific Node.js environment, but it's running within the React Native runtime. This mismatch can cause the library to fail.

```javascript
// bug.js
import { someLibraryFunction } from 'some-third-party-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  someLibraryFunction(); // This might throw an error in React Native
  return <Text>Hello</Text>;
};
```
