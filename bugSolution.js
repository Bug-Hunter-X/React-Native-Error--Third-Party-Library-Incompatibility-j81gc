The best solution is to find a React Native compatible alternative or adapt the library.  Sometimes the library provides a React Native specific build or instructions.  If not, careful inspection of the library code may allow modifications to work around the environment differences.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
//Alternative approach - use a different library that's compatible with React Native
//Instead of using someLibraryFunction from 'some-third-party-library'
const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    //Simulate the desired functionality with React Native compatible method
    console.log('React Native compatible action');
  }, []);
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>React Native Compatible Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
